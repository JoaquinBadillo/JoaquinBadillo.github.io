## Technologies Used

* React JS
* D3
* Leaflet
* PostgreSQL


## Responsibilities

For this project I have mainly focused on the front end; what I found interesting about my role as a Front-End Developer this time was that I had to follow the design specification of a UX designer and that was recently assigned the role of front end lead.

## Challenges

Working on data visualization is interesting as these should make the information clear for users without introducing bias. Moreover, as it is a *visual* representation of data, it is important to find accessible ways to represent the data for any user.
