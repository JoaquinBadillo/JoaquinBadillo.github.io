## Challenges

---

This project was challenging as it was made possible by a team of 3 members in a decently small amount of time. The 3 of us had to learn how to use the Unity Game Engine, while trying to implement the features we thought about on our previously written Game Design Document (GDD). 

It was also difficult to find where to deploy the project and connect all the services, as we had to use a database, an API and a website. We ended up using Railway for the API and Database, while GitHub Pages allowed us to deploy the front-end with ease.
