## Technologies Used

I worked on this project when I started my role as an On Campus Intern at [Tecnológico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en). I worked remotely as a Front-End Developer and I used the following technologies:

* React JS
* SASS CSS


## Functionality

The website provides information, geographical visualizations and an analysis of the urban expansion of the city Monterrey in Nuevo León Mexico and the dangers of a quick expansion.

## Challenges

The main challenge I faced during this project was that I joined an existing project and the only way I could learn about the project was through personal communication with my colleagues and through the source code.
