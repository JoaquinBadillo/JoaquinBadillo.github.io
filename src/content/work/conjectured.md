## Technologies Used

---

* React
* NextJS
* PostgreSQL
* Supabase Buckets
* Vercel


## Functionality

---

This project was made as a hobby project to have some impact in education. I've always been passionate about sharing knowledge and I think that by posting about technical fields like mathematics and computer science, combining rigorous and thorough proofs with experiences and intuition I can make the concepts more accessible to people.


## Challenges

---

The main challenge in this project was defining the project itself, but doing so with some degree of thoroughness by defining the scope of the project and the features that I wanted to implement. For instance I decided to make it dynamic by storing data in a database and using buckets so that I could upload posts while the service is live. It was also one of the first times I used resources in the cloud and I made some research on different services that could allow me to ship a hobby project in an affordable and fast way.
